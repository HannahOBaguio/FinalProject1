			BlubBlub! Hi there, this website was made by a highschool student! (The picture beside this is unrelated to the creator, but his name is 			Christofish)</p>
		<p>
			However, this student is still a beginner on making these websites. So there will a few errors and mistakes, also small content, in this water 			website. Although with a beginner skill level, this creator is still learing how to improve and to create more better websites in the 				future.</p>
		<p>
			So let's take on this aquatic adventure together! You may contact the creator by pressing her <a 								href="mailto:hannahmignonette.baguio@gmail.com" target=_blank>gmail account.</a></p>
		<p>
			In this student's school, they were task to make a website that could help the enviroment or to share awareness about a specific issue. So, the 			student chooses this aquatic topic or issue because it seemed interesting and intriging to learn the issues and situations faced by the 			underwater enviroment. It felt like there was more to it than what's on the news. So, from the tip of the ice-burg to the student took a deep 			dive on exploring what situations underneath aquatic life.</p>
		<p>
			Although, this website is empty at the moment...NEVER BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN DEPTHS IN THE OCEAN 𓆉 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 𓆝 𓆟
