		<h1>~~Research~~</h1>
		<div class="box">
			<p>There are multiple scientifc studies about the ocean. One of these scientific studies discovered that effective marine protected areas  			(MPAs) are a crucial part for ocean conservation. Many studies have shown that well protected marine locations provides a benefit on helping 			the aquatic ecosystems to be conserved. With an increase of aquatic populations and a recovery of once depleted species, and building a strong 			immunity against climate change. We could use this research for creating stategies and solutions for less protected aquatic areas.</p>

			<p>Example of the strategies organizations used to conserve oceans is by establishing marine protected areas (MPAs). Based from our discussion 			earlier, it is an effective way to conserve and protect the ocean biome. Another example is combating pollution. Since pollution is one of the 			cause for the causalities in oceans. It is an effective way to protect oceans from any more damage.<p>

			<p>With technology also advacing, there are also aquatic devices that aims to help protect aquatic biomes. Tools such as autonomous underwater 			vehicles (AUVs) and waste management technologies, provides aid towards our oceans. Helping it to be sustained and conserved. While also 			colecting data about its situations.</p>

			<p>Organizations also conducted experiments on ways on how to conserve the ocean. An experiment such as re-seeding reefs is a good exaple for 			this. It is a method where they collect coral eggs and sperm to restore the damage found in coral reefs. First, they carefully collected the 			eggs and provide a controlled enviroment, such as nursery labs. The species would be nurtured until they reach a point in their life where they 			are ready to settle on reefs. They would be put transplanted on damage areas of the reef, allowing the growth of new coral colonies.</p>
